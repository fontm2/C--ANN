# C#ANN
In summer 2017 my interest in ML came up. The only progrmming language I knwe back thes was C# which i have learned from selfe studies.
Without any knowledge of Python i tried to create a small framework for getting some first insights in Machine Learning. After my experiments i was sure to take as much courses in machine learning at the university to improve my knowledge gained by web research.

I am still no software developper and no that conversant with design patterns
